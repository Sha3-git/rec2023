Budget data schema
User should have a budget for each month 
for each month the user will define their want, needs, and expenses
--> take the total dollar amount 
--> each should be an array of object data with the name of the want/need/expense, the dollar amount, the card used, month, year, 
for each month the user will define their current balance which will include money from their credit card and money from their bank account
--> show total monthly expenditure and the monthly savings
--> user should be able to select which expenditure goes on which card
for each year there will be a graph showing month versus expenditure 
-->the amount they saved (yearly income total - yearly amount spent )
